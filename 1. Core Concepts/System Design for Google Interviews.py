# In system design interviews, you are expected to design scalable and maintainable systems like YouTube, Google Maps, or a messaging service.

# ðŸ”§ Steps for System Design:
# 1. Clarify requirements â€“ Ask questions like:
#       What is the expected traffic?
#       What are the main use cases?
#       What are the non-functional requirements (latency, availability)?

# 2. High-level architecture â€“ Design components like:
#       Load balancer
#       Web servers
#       Database (SQL vs NoSQL)
#       Cache
#       Message queue
# 3. Detail key components â€“ Go deep into one part of your system (e.g., how to store videos).
# 4. Scalability & bottlenecks â€“ Discuss how the system will scale with more users.
