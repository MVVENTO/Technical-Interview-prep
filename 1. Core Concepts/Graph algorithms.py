# Graph algorithms are essential for solving problems like shortest paths, cycle detection, and connectivity.

# ðŸ”§ Example: Depth-First Search (DFS)

def dfs(graph, node, visited=set()):
    if node not in visited:
        print(node, end=" ")
        visited.add(node)
        for neighbor in graph[node]:
            dfs(graph, neighbor, visited)

# Test
graph = {
    'A': ['B', 'C'],
    'B': ['D', 'E'],
    'C': ['F'],
    'D': [],
    'E': ['F'],
    'F': []
}
dfs(graph, 'A')  # Output: A B D E F C
