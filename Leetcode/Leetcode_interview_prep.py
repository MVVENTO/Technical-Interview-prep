# Tips for Success:
# Master Data Structures and Algorithms: This is key to passing Google's coding interviews. Focus on understanding how and why algorithms work.
# Practice Hard Problems: The harder the problems you practice, the better. LeetCode problems marked as Medium and Hard closely reflect the difficulty you'll face in an interview.
# Mock Interviews: Practice coding under time constraints, ideally with a peer. Use platforms like Pramp or Interviewing.io.
# System Design Practice: For higher-level positions, you'll need to solve system design questions. Books like "Designing Data-Intensive Applications" by Martin Kleppmann or "System Design Interview" by Alex Xu are great resources.
# By focusing on these key problems and topics, you'll be well-prepared to tackle the technical challenges presented during a Google interview.


# General Tips:
# Practice Coding: Regularly solve problems on platforms like LeetCode, HackerRank, or Codeforces. Start with easier problems and progressively tackle harder ones.
# System Design: While system design is typically more emphasized for senior roles, understanding the basics of designing scalable systems is crucial. 
# Review common design patterns and practice designing components like databases, distributed systems, etc.
# Mock Interviews: Participate in mock interviews to get a feel for real interview scenarios. Sites like Pramp and Interviewing.io offer peer or professional mock interviews.
# By consistently practicing these problems, you'll improve your problem-solving skills, which are crucial for success in a Google technical interview.
