Stacks
Definition
A stack is a linear data structure that follows the Last In First Out (LIFO) principle.
The most recently added element is the one that is removed first.
Operations
Push: Add an element to the top of the stack.
Pop: Remove and return the top element of the stack.
Peek/Top: Return the top element without removing it.
IsEmpty: Check if the stack is empty.
Implementation
Array-Based Stack:
Use an array to store elements.
Keep an index to track the top of the stack.
